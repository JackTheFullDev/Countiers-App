# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
My First approach to TypeScript and Tailwind.
I mainly  focused on understanding how  to use Typescript with React and also how to create fast and responisve apps with css framework. 
There is some room to implement better types, create better components and make the code much better for analysis, but a great app to create and learn new things.
